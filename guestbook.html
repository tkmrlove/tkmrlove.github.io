As the months went by and I quickly became a regular, I would be greeted by your ever improving art and dedication through your new models and evolving stream layouts.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Just being in chat and listening to your passion come through during your art streams, Zillow reviews, and your many game playthroughs regularly made my day time and time again. I became part of the goshujin wagies who would rush home to catch streams after quittin' time and it's a badge I wear proudly.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>(note to maid: Goshujin Wagie badges would be a fun shop item)&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>The community you've fostered is one of the best around and I'm so happy to be a part of it. Shootin' the shit in the discord, hanging out during Anime Club, and the palpable excitement at the ever approaching TakaCon 2025 are just slices of the camaraderie I've come to know as a silly bunny following this maid around.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>I love hearing your voice when you sing, laugh, gush, and do silly impressions. Your having fun is a great joy to behold and I'm looking forward to many more streams of you being able to have fun.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Look forward to my boring congratulatory message this time next year knowing I'll be spending that time trying to order a box of ruby chocolates to smuggle into the United States (in minecraft)
